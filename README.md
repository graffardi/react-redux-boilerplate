# react-redux-boilerplate
react-redux-boilerplate is a quick start React and Redux application, this is the template I use for every project.

This template allows you to build a React application that uses Redux, feel free to use Axios for API calls, but remember to store them in an action.

You can also find an action, a container and a reducer example in the src folder. All these files can be used as reminders.

**Remember that the Redux data flow is:**
```
- Action
- Reducer
- Root Reducer
- Container
```
